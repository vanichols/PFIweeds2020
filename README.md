# PFIweeds2020

<!-- badges: start -->

[![Lifecycle:
experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of PFIweeds2020 is to grant easy access to data and analysis
functions for the 2020 Practical Farmers of Iowa project looking at the
effect of cover-cropping on the weed seedbank.

Someday I will put a map of the sampling locations here\!

## Installation

The development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) can be
accessed with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("vanichols/PFIweeds2020")
```

## Example

An example wonâ€™t really do much good here.

``` r
library(PFIweeds2020)
## basic example code
```
