<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of weedseedspfi2020 is to grant easy access to data and
analysis functions for the 2020 Practical Farmers of Iowa project
looking at the effect of cover-cropping on the weed seedbank.

Someday I will put a map of the sampling locations here\!

## Installation

The development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) can be
accessed with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("vanichols/weedseedspfi2020")
```

## Example

An example won’t really do much good here.

``` r
library(weedseedspfi2020)
## basic example code
```
